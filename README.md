# Rossmann-Stores-Sales-Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting the daily sales of Rossmann drug stores. The goal is to predict the "Sales" column for a test set using historical sales data from 1,115 Rossmann stores across 7 European countries.

## Project Overview
The task of predicting daily sales is crucial for Rossmann store managers to plan their operations effectively. However, with thousands of individual managers making predictions based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can vary significantly.

To address this challenge, this project aims to develop a predictive model that takes into account various factors that influence store sales, including promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality. By analyzing the historical sales data, we can create a reliable forecasting model to provide accurate sales predictions for up to six weeks in advance.

## Project Structure
The project repository consists of the following files:

Rossmann_sales_forecast.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
data: Directory containing the datasets used in the project.
README.md: Readme document providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

+ Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Southboy12/Rossmann-Stores-Sales-Forecasting.git
+ Install the required dependencies using pip or conda by running pip install -r requirements.txt or conda install --file requirements.txt.
+ Open the Rossmann_sales_forecast.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
+ Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The project aims to provide accurate sales predictions for Rossmann store managers. By leveraging historical sales data and considering various factors that influence sales, the developed forecasting model can help managers plan their operations more effectively and make informed decisions.

## Conclusion
The Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting project offers a data-driven approach to predict daily sales for Rossmann drug stores. By analyzing historical sales data and incorporating relevant factors, the project provides valuable insights and accurate forecasts. The developed model can be a valuable tool for store managers to optimize their operations and improve overall sales performance.
